## Pronunciation

Over the course of development for SUAVE much debate went into how to pronounce the name correctly. We wondered, is it SUA - VEY, is it a hair care product, is it Stanford University Avenue, or possibly SWAVEY. Then there is the often written SAUVE, this is just wrong. For now we will stay cool, and keep washing our hair.
