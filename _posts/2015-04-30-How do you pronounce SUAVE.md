## Pronunciation

Over the course of development for SUAVE much debate went into how to pronounce the name correctly. We wondered, is it SUA - VEY, is it a hair care product, is it Stanford University Avenue, or possibly SWAVEY. We are absolutely certain though that it is not the Stanford University UAV club, they are [here](uav.stanford.edu). Then there is the often written SAUVE and SUave... these are just wrong.

This is one example of how to pronounce SUAVE.
