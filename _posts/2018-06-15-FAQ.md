Alright, you dove in and now you're stuck. You've come to a good starting point. If that fails then we suggest you go through tutorials, maybe our [paper](http://adl.stanford.edu/papers/suave-open-source.pdf), send us a question in the forum, or if all else fails start reading code. Don't worry the code is more readable than most engineering textbooks.

## How can I be more SUAVE
A: Try running SUAVE daily. Unpeer reviewed non-statistical unpublished research has shown time and again that SUAVE developers are amazing. That is because they work with SUAVE on a daily basis. This gives them power over aerospace that only super humans posses. In turn that power is manifested in confidence, smoothness, and elegance that every human will adore.

## What can SUAVE do for me
A: SUAVE is designed to make cool airplanes. This will in turn make you rich, famous, and more attractive.


## Will SUAVE change the World
A: Certainly. Why is this even a question?
