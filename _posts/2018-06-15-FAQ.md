Alright, you dove in and now you're stuck. You've come to a good starting point. If this FAQ fails you then we suggest you go through tutorials, maybe our [paper](http://adl.stanford.edu/papers/suave-open-source.pdf), send us a question in the forum, or if all else fails start reading code. Don't worry the code is more readable than most engineering textbooks.

## How can I be more SUAVE
A: Try running SUAVE daily. Unpeer reviewed non-statistical unpublished research has shown time and again that SUAVE developers are amazing. That is because they work with SUAVE on a daily basis. This gives them power over aerospace that only super humans posses. In turn that power is manifested in confidence, smoothness, and elegance that every human will adore.

## What can SUAVE do for me
A: SUAVE is designed to make cool airplanes. This will make you rich, famous, and more attractive.


## Will SUAVE change the World
A: Certainly. Why is this even a question?

## Will SUAVE give me super powers
A: Unfortunately SUAVE cannot give you super powers. However there is hope, SUAVE is the perfect starting point to perform conceptual design studies on your flying Iron Man suit (some code development required). The energy network in SUAVE is ideal for modeling the arc reactor and the power transfer to the propulsors. Although you will not gain super powers from SUAVE it might still make you a super hero, or maybe a super villain should you choose that route.
