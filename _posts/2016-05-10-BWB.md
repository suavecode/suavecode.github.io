## Blended Wing Body with CFD

# Introduction

The purpose of this tutorial is to show a user how to generate geometry, mesh, and run CFD via SU2 from SUAVE. For the design example we an unconventional configuration, a Blended Wing Body (BWB). The BWB used here is most similar to the Boeing BWB-450 by Liebeck.

There are several ways this tutorial could be useful. First it shows how geometry is generated in SUAVE and sent to OpenVSP. Secondly it shows the chain of tools from geometry generation in OpenVSP, to mesh generation using GMSH, to CFD using SU2. Finally, if you already have CFD or other aerodynamic data you will learn how to input it into SUAVE directly.

# Other Software You need

For the full tool chain 3 additional pieces of software are needed. These include OpenVSP, GMSH, and SU2. Fortunately for you, these are all open source and freely available online.

First, you will need [OpenVSP](http://openvsp.org) compiled with Python support. Unfortunately, you cannot use the precompiled binary versions of OpenVSP. You must compile it from scratch.

Second, you must install [GMSH](http://gmsh.info). In this case you can use the precompiled binaries. Make sure to add GMSH to your command line path, so it can be called from a terminal.

Finally, you need to install [SU2](http://su2.stanford.edu). If you want parallel support then you must also compile the code. Otherwise, you can the precompiled versions.

# Vehicle Setup

Here is the first time look at multi-segment wings. With multi-segments we can tune in more complex shapes such as cranks, yehudis, and winglets. We can also specify an airfoil to the wing or a wing segment. However, if you do not specify an airfoil it will default to a symmetrical airfoil profile.

This BWB is broken down into 7 segments. We first specify the top level overal parameters of the wing and then add each segment sequentially as shown below.

When we specify the configuration then we can write the OpenVSP file. If there are multiple configurations then you will need multiple writes to OpenVSP. We highly suggest you only have one configuration to minimize computational costs.

<pre><code class="python">
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Define the Configurations
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

def configs_setup(vehicle):

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    #   Initialize Configurations
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------

    configs = SUAVE.Components.Configs.Config.Container()

    base_config = SUAVE.Components.Configs.Config(vehicle)
    base_config.tag = 'base'
    configs.append(base_config)
    
    write(vehicle,base_config.tag) 


    # done!
    return configs

# Analyses Setup

Here we setup the SU2 analysis. We left commented out the parallel setting if you want to parallelize the computation along with the number of processors to use.

The next setting which is commented out is the input file for pregenerated CFD data. We have included an example of this, even if you don't have SU2 and GMSH installed you can still run this file to generate the surrogate and run the mission.

After that we specify the points we want generate the surrogate on. Default values are within SUAVE, but we suggest the user specify their own Mach numbers and angles of attack.

Next we use a trick to refine the mesh. This is optional. We change the source parameters at specific segments. Here we make the sources more compact which refines the mesh at the root area.

The rest of the code runs as usual. However, we add in an extra plot which shows the surrogate and the points interpolated.
