## Intro

So, I've finally decided to start blogging, this is something I've been wanting to do for quite a long time now but work and personal life have managed to keep me busy up to now.

&nbsp;

## What to expect from this blog
Some random rants; thoughts about art, design, programming and maybe the answer to life and everything.

## Tools of the trade

- [Photoshop](https://adobe.com) ─ Used mainly for design and mockups.
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) ─ Super awesome text-editor.
- [Github](https://github.com) ─ Free hosting with Github Pages, and super fast version control system.
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) ─ Insanely fast blog-aware static site generator.
- [Typekit](http://typekit.com) ─ Great collection of hosted fonts.
- [Moments.js](http://momentjs.com/) ─ Responsible for the relative date/time format on this blog.
