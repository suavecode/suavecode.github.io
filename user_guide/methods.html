												<h2>Methods</h2>
												<p>
													Methods are where the proverbial rubber begins to meet the road in
													SUAVE. Up until this point, the User Guide has covered primarily how
													SUAVE stores and organizes data. Methods are how SUAVE uses that
													data to calculate performance and characteristics of the vehicle.
												</p>
												<p>
													Methods themselves are design to be relatively "atomic" -
													self-contained, straight-forward input-output functions. This both
													allows some of them to be broken out of SUAVE entirely and used in
													much the same way as NumPy or SciPy functions, but "within" SUAVE
													it allows them to be swapped in and out or assembled into more
													complicated Analyses, which are covered in a separate section.
												</p>
												<p>
													Generally speaking, SUAVE Methods are sensitive to their input
													parameters and data types. They are "Garbage In, Garbage Out" and
													are not robust against non-physical or physically impossible setups.
													If methods seem to be returning non-sensical, non-numerical, or
													unconverging values, they are likely reflecting the physical
													impossibility of the inputs.
												</p>
												<p>
													Because the Methods can be driven to such extremes by a wide
													variety of conditions, there is little customized error handling.
													The burden lies on the user to ensure that their input models and
													data are sensible and well structured.
												</p>

												<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>
												<p>
													Aerodynamic Methods are those used to solve aerodynamic equations
													for input vehicle/wing geometries. They include lifting line and
													potential flow solvers like the Weissinger Vortex Lattice and
													Athena Vortex Lattice methods, as well inviscid and Euler CFD
													solutions through interface with the SU2 CFD package.
												</p>
												<p>
													They are typically used to resolve lift and drag vectors for
													aerodynamic surfaces and vehicles. Where the solver also
													provides pertinent stability information, processing of this
													information is performed with a separate and Analysis.
												</p>

												<h3>Propulsion</h3>
												<p>
													Propusion Methods include those used in the analysis of propulsion
													systems, including turbofans, propeller systems, and rocket motors.
													They include methods for sizing these systems and resolving thrust
													vectors.
												</p>
												<p>
													Because propulsors are usually highly coupled to the energy network
													of a vehicle, many of these methods are only meaningful when used to
													analyze a fully described energy network. For instance, use of
													propeller methods on a battery powered vehicle without consideration
													of the stateof charge and available voltage of the battery may
													overestimate the thrust the propeller could provide.
												</p>

												<h3>Weights</h3>
												<p>
													Weights are those Methods concerned with estimating the mass and
													weight of a vehicle and its various components. At present, these
													Methods are separated into two types - Correlations, and Buildups.
												</p>
												<p>
													Correlation methods use historical data to estimate the weight of a
													new aircraft of similar configuration and operational plan. SUAVE
													utilizes Methods of this type to estimate the weight of most
													aircraft including tube-and-wing civil transports, general aviation
													craft, and blended-wing-bodies. Buildups use ground-up physics based
													component sizing to arrive at a weight estimate. SUAVE uses Methods
													of this type for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.
												</p>

												<h3>Center of Gravity</h3>
												<p>
													Center of Gravity (CG) Methods estimate the location of a vehicle's
													CG, the CGs of its components, and fuel loads. These methods are
													typically coupled with methods in the Flight Dynamics library for
													estimating vehicle stability parameters, but may be used
													independently if desired. They  require all components to be
													assigned individual origin attributes in a consistent and cohesive
													manner.
												</p>

												<h3>Flight Dynamics</h3>
												<p>
													Flight Dynamics Methods are those concerned with estimating a
													vehicle's static and dynamic stability margins and derivatives. They
													are built into SUAVE and may therefore be used separately from or
													in addition to aerodynamic solvers such as AVL which provide
													similar information.
												</p>

												<h3>Costs</h3>
												<p>
													Cost Methods estimate the industrial and operating costs of a
													vehicle based on the physical and Cost attributes assigned to the
													model.
												</p>

												<h3>Geometry</h3>
												<p>
													Geometry Methods are largely supporting methods used in substeps of
													other Methods, such as processing data for airfoils, cross-sectional
													areas inside of jet engines, or projected planforms of aerodynamic
													surfaces. They may however, also prove useful when used outside of
													SUAVE Methods as independent functions.
												</p>

												<h3>Noise</h3>
												<p>
													Noise Methods are used to estimate jet-wash, propeller, airframe,
													and other sources of operational noise when the aircraft is in
													operation. At present, SUAVE's methods for noise estimation include
													a number of correlative and low-fidelity physics based methods.
