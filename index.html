                <p>SUAVE, a conceptual level aircraft design environment, incorporates multiple information sources to analyze conventional and unconventional configurations. Many software tools for aircraft conceptual design rely upon empirical correlations and other handbook approximations. SUAVE proposes a way to design aircraft featuring advanced technologies by augmenting relevant correlations with physics-based methods. </p>

                <p>SUAVE is an open source suite constructed as a modular set of analysis tools written in Python. Additional capabilities can be incorporated using extensible interfaces and prototyped with a top-level script. The flexibility of the environment allows the creation of arbitrary mission profiles, unconventional propulsion networks, and right-fidelity at right-time discipline analyses. SUAVE is currently being developed in the<a href="http://adl.stanford.edu">Aerospace Design Lab at Stanford University</a>. For more information regarding SUAVE's background see our publication<a href="http://adl.stanford.edu/papers/suave-open-source.pdf">here</a>.</p>
